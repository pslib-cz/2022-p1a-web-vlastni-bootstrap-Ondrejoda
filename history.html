              <p class="card-text">Linux, an open-source operating system, has a rich history that can be traced back to Unix, its predecessor. Unix was created in the late 1960s by AT&T Bell Labs and was initially only available on a limited number of mainframe computers. As Unix grew in popularity, other companies began to sell their versions of the operating system, including Microsoft, which sold its own version called Xenix. In the 1980s, AT&T sold Unix to Novell, which then sold it to The Santa Cruz Operation (SCO).</p>

              <p class="card-text">The popularity of Linux led to the development of many different distributions, each with its own unique features and focus. One of the earliest and most popular distributions was Debian, which was first released in 1993 and was known for its stability and strong community support. Fedora, another popular distribution, was created by Red Hat in 2003 and was designed to be a community-driven, cutting-edge operating system. Ubuntu, which was first released in 2004, has become one of the most popular distributions among desktop users and is known for its ease of use and focus on user experience. Finally, Arch Linux, which was first released in 2002, is a lightweight and customizable distribution that is popular among power users and developers.</p>

              <p class="card-text">In the early 1990s, a computer science student at the University of Helsinki named Linus Torvalds began working on his own operating system kernel, which he named Linux. Torvalds released the first version of Linux in 1991, and it quickly gained popularity among computer enthusiasts and developers. Linux was different from Unix in that it was free and open-source, which meant that anyone could download the source code and modify it to suit their needs.</p>
